APP Academy Cap-Stone Project
Project Idea: A R2-D2 inspired App Academy Robot

This is the part where I set my expections really high and watch them get 
crushed in front of my eyes. Just Kidding. This is the general direction 
I shall take my droid project in to try and pace myself instead of "going 
all in". Eveything may not be completely finished but At least you know what 
I was going for at the end. 

This document will be updated as I complete desired feature or think of more. 
And once the project is done, all features can be found here.

Brainstorming:

Possible R2 Features:			Completed: Y/N		Date:
- Fully Constructed R2 Droid
