APP Academy Cap-Stone Project Proposal
Project Idea: A R2-D2 inspired App Academy Robot

For my final capstone project, I have decided on making a R2-D2 inspired App Academy Robot. 
The reason why I decided on something so demanding because I want to push myself further than 
I have before, I’ve done many simple projects and I kinda want to experiment with what I have 
done this year with Arduino. Why a robot? Well, I wanted incoming freshmen to have a reason to 
be excited to join the App Academy and stay through all the years, like how I did when first 
joining the App Academy through Dexter. 

Many challenges I might face while creating this robot is resources. I don’t know exactly how 
much I would need for such an ambitious project so to estimate, I would have to build a small 
scale version. That way I could make small mistakes instead of Blowing out all in one go. The 
thing I shall tackle first would be the use of a controller to send signals to and fro the droid. 
Of course with coding, there are a lot of errors made so that can be expected as well. This 
project will be heavily inspired by James Bruton's R6 Droid. (https://www.youtube.com/user/jamesbruton)
